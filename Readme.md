## üõ†Ô∏è Design and Approach

- Built using **React Native** with **Expo** for cross-platform support.
- Uses **Expo Location API** to fetch geolocation-based weather data.
- Fetches weather data from **OpenWeatherMap API**.
- Simple state management using **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- Dynamic backgrounds based on weather conditions.
- Manual city search with API-powered suggestions.
- Favorites stored locally using **AsyncStorage**.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions & Limitations

- Users will grant location permissions to fetch geolocation-based data.
- The app requires an active internet connection to fetch weather data.
- No offline mode or caching implemented.
- Error handling for API errors, and denied permissions.
